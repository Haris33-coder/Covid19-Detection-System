Dataset details:
It is a simple directory structure branched into test and train and further branched into the respective 3 classes which contains the images. The dataset contains the three folders each folder containing the X-ray images. Individual X-rays folders are of these kind of patients:
1.	Covid-19 infected
2.	Normal
3.	Viral Pneumonia

It  contains around 137 cleaned images of COVID-19 and 317 in total containing Viral Pneumonia and Normal Chest X-Rays structured into the test and train directories.

Description:	
	We will be subjecting this dataset to multiple machine learning models in order to find useful patterns in the images which can then be use to used to classify the X-ray of any patients into three categories (Covid-19, Normal, Viral Pneumonia). X-rays are of the chest but mainly focused on lungs where infection normally resides.
